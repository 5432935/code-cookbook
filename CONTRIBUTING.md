**Thanks for contributing to the Haxe Code Cookbook!**

### Formatting 

 * braces on same line
 * two-space indentation
 * no type-hints for local variables and function return unless it's instructive
 * type-hints for fields
 * type-hints for function arguments unless it's very obvious
 * judicious use of extra line-breaks to avoid ugly automatic breaks (check the output)
 
This would be a typical template to use. Use <code>```haxe</code> for syntax highlighting.  
The first line of a snippet is the title used in the menu. Keep this title short.
 
```markdown
   # Title of the page

   Description and explanation of the code.

   ## Implementation
   ```haxe
    class Test {
      // Code here
    }
    ```
   ## Usage
    ```haxe
    class Test {
      // Code here
    }
    ```
