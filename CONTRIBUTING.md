### Formatting 

 * First line of a snippet is the title used in the menu. Keep this title short.
 * Use 2 spaces instead of tabs.
 * Braces on the same line.
 
This would be a typical template to use. Use <code>```haxe</code> for syntax highlighting.

   # Title of the page

   Description and explanation of the code.
